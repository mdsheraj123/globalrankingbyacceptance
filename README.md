## Background:

The existing rankings are too subjective and biased. Since I am not racist or a xenophobe and see all people as equals and I do not believe in IQ tests, rather as fluid beings with persistent efforts shaping who we are, I believe in objectivity. 

I judge the quality of a college by the acceptance rate of it. I have not taken into account pre-selection or ease of application as these are subjective and hard to quantify, also they are applicable to all for different reasons. This ranking is purely objective and data based and I hope you take this into consideration when you apply to a program at a college because this will impact the quality of your peer group.

The rationale is that concepts like race, gender, or ethnicity, and so on are human made and why limit our focus on only what we have perceived. I believe in the diversity of individuals on factors way beyond outer appearance and even people with the same race, gender, or ethnicity, and so on can be extremely different and diverse.

I never found a purely objective global ranking, so I have made one myself. Everyone is free to contribute via pull requests.
